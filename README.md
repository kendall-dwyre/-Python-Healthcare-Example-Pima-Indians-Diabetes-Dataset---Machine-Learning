# Machine-Learning
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate machine learning skills by going through a dataset from online. 

The dataset that I am working with is called "Pima Indians Diabetes Database" from Kaggle.  You can find a link to it here:

Explanation about the dataset from Kaggle:

	This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The 		objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on 				certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of 	these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old 		of Pima Indian heritage.
